Note: My project server-side has been written in Python 3 using Flask (no PHP)

Instructions: In command line run: python(3) app.py
site will run on 127.0.0.1:8000


A very challenging and interesting project! This was my first time
using flask and bootstrap so I apologize in advance for any crazy looking code
or illogical routes.

After many, many hours putting this together (and banging my head against the wall!),
I conceded that it was time to get this submitted and move on to revising for the exam.

Here's a few things I couldn't achieve that I would really appreciate feedback on: 

Making flask check individual file sizes
Submitting comments that immediately appear on the div (my code requires reloading the overlay)
Predictive entry of username and tag
My recently uploaded gallery returns incorrect information on image click (why god why?)


I really enjoyed putting this together. It's not pretty, but I think it works (more or less)!
